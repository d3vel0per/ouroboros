# ooo evolve - Evolutionary Loop

## Description
Start, monitor, or rewind an evolutionary development loop. The loop iteratively
refines the ontology and acceptance criteria across generations until convergence.

## Flow
```
Gen 1: Interview → Seed(O₁) → Execute → Evaluate
Gen 2: Wonder → Reflect → Seed(O₂) → Execute → Evaluate
Gen 3: Wonder → Reflect → Seed(O₃) → Execute → Evaluate
...until ontology converges (similarity ≥ 0.95) or max 30 generations
```

## Usage

### Start a new evolutionary loop
```
ooo evolve "build a task management CLI"
```

### Fast mode (ontology-only, no execution)
```
ooo evolve "build a task management CLI" --no-execute
```

### Check lineage status
```
ooo evolve --status <lineage_id>
```

### Rewind to a previous generation
```
ooo evolve --rewind <lineage_id> <generation_number>
```

## Instructions

### Path A: MCP Available (check for `ouroboros_evolve_step` tool)

**Starting a new evolutionary loop:**
1. Parse the user's input as `initial_context`
2. Run the interview: call `ouroboros_interview` with `initial_context`
3. Complete the interview (3+ rounds until ambiguity ≤ 0.2)
4. Generate seed: call `ouroboros_generate_seed` with the `session_id`
5. Call `ouroboros_evolve_step` with:
   - `lineage_id`: new unique ID (e.g., `lin_<seed_id>`)
   - `seed_content`: the generated seed YAML
   - `execute`: `true` (default) for full Execute→Evaluate pipeline,
     `false` for fast ontology-only evolution (no seed execution)
6. Check the `action` in the response:
   - `continue` → Call `ouroboros_evolve_step` again with just `lineage_id`
   - `converged` → Evolution complete! Display final ontology
   - `stagnated` → Ontology unchanged for 3+ gens. Consider `ouroboros_lateral_think`
   - `exhausted` → Max 30 generations reached. Display best result
   - `failed` → Check error, possibly retry
7. **Repeat step 6** until action ≠ `continue`
8. When the loop terminates, display a result summary with next step:
   - `converged`: `📍 Done! Ontology converged. Run ooo evaluate for formal verification`
   - `stagnated`: `📍 Next: ooo unstuck to break through with lateral thinking, then ooo evolve to resume`
   - `exhausted`: `📍 Next: ooo evaluate to check best result — or ooo unstuck to try a new approach`
   - `failed`: `📍 Next: Check the error above. ooo status to inspect session, or ooo unstuck if blocked`

**Checking status:**
1. Call `ouroboros_lineage_status` with the `lineage_id`
2. Display: generation count, ontology evolution, convergence progress

**Rewinding:**
1. Call `ouroboros_evolve_step` with:
   - `lineage_id`: the lineage to continue from a rewind point
   - `seed_content`: the seed YAML from the target generation
   (Future: dedicated `ouroboros_evolve_rewind` tool)

### Path B: Plugin-only (no MCP tools available)

If MCP tools are not available, explain the evolutionary loop concept and
suggest installing the Ouroboros MCP server:

```
pip install ouroboros-ai
ouroboros mcp serve
```

Then add to Claude Code's MCP configuration.

## Key Concepts

- **Wonder**: "What do we still not know?" - examines evaluation results
  to identify ontological gaps and hidden assumptions
- **Reflect**: "How should the ontology evolve?" - proposes specific
  mutations to fields, acceptance criteria, and constraints
- **Convergence**: Loop stops when ontology similarity ≥ 0.95 between
  consecutive generations, or after 30 generations max
- **Rewind**: Each generation is a snapshot. You can rewind to any
  generation and branch evolution from there
- **evolve_step**: Runs exactly ONE generation per call. Designed for
  Ralph integration — state is fully reconstructed from events between calls
- **execute flag**: `true` (default) runs full Execute→Evaluate each generation.
  `false` skips execution for fast ontology exploration. Previous generation's
  execution output is fed into Wonder/Reflect for informed evolution
- **QA verdict**: Each generation's response includes a QA Verdict section
  (when `execute=true` and `skip_qa` is not set). Use the QA score to track
  quality progression across generations. Pass `skip_qa: true` to disable
